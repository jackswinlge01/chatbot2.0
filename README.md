### basic java chatobot for computer programming 2 class

This program contains a chatbot object

The chatbot object uses ArrayLists to hold possible values for things like the chatbot's name, favorite hobby, quirk, etc...

The chatbot constructor chooses one of these values at random and stores them in the chatbot's Memory object.

The program then promts the user to "chat" with the chatbot; scanning the user input. 

The chatbot interact function checks user input for certain keywords such as "hello" or "favorite".

If one of these keywords are found, the interact function calls the corresponding reply function to reply to the user.

The program loops until the user enters "exit".
